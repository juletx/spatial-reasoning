I would like to thank everyone that has helped in the development of this project. Specially to my directors Oier Lopez de Lacalle and Aitor Soroa. I also want to thank Gorka Azkune, Ander Salaberria and Eneko Agirre, who have also attended the weekly meetings and have taken part in the annotation process. Their ideas and advice have helped me a lot in this work.
