\subsection{Image-to-Image Generation}

Stable Diffusion could be used to generate new images as a data augmentation technique. For example, multiple image variations can be generated from an input image, to get similar images that still match the original caption. We could also change the caption if we are interested in getting similar images with different object. In painting could also be used to change an specific part of the image.
